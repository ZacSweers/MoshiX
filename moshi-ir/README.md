Moshi-IR
========

A Kotlin IR implementation of Moshi code gen and moshi-sealed code gen.

The goal of this is to have functional parity with their native Kapt/KSP code gen analogues but run as a fully 
embedded IR plugin.

**Benefits**
- Significantly faster build times.
  - No extra Kapt or KSP tasks, no extra source files to compile. This runs directly in kotlinc and generates IR 
    that is lowered directly into bytecode.
- No reflection required at runtime to support default parameter values.
- Feature parity with Moshi's native code gen.
- More detailed error messages for unexpected null values and missing properties. Now all errors are accumulated and 
  reported at the end, rather than failing eagerly with just the first one encountered.
  - See https://github.com/square/moshi/issues/836 for more details!

**Cons**
- No support for Proguard file generation for now [#193](https://github.com/ZacSweers/MoshiX/issues/193). You will
  need to add this manually to your rules if you use R8/Proguard.
  - One option is to use IR in debug builds and Kapt/KSP in release builds, the latter of which do still generate
    proguard rules.
  ```proguard
  # Keep names for JsonClass-annotated classes
  -keepnames @com.squareup.moshi.JsonClass class **

  # Keep generated adapter classes' constructors
  -keepclassmembers class *JsonAdapter {
      public <init>(...);
  }
  ```
- Kotlin IR is not a stable API and may change in future Kotlin versions. While I'll try to publish quickly to adjust to
these, you should be aware. If you have any issues, you can always fall back to Kapt/KSP.

### Installation

Simply apply the Gradle plugin in your project to use it. You can enable moshi-sealed code gen via the `moshi` 
extension.

The Gradle plugin is published to Maven Central, so ensure you have `mavenCentral()` visible to your buildscript 
classpath.

```gradle
plugins {
  kotlin("jvm")
  id("dev.zacsweers.moshix") version "x.y.z"
}

moshi {
  // Opt-in to enable moshi-sealed, disabled by default.
  enableSealed.set(true)
}
```
