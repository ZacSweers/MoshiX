/**
 * `object` types are useful in cases when receiving empty json objects (`{}`) or cases where its
 * type can be inferred by some delegating adapter that peeks its keys. They should only be used for
 * types that are sentinels and do not actually contain meaningful data.
 *
 * In this example, we have a [FunctionSpec] that defines the signature of a function, and the below
 * [Type] representations that can be used for its return type and parameter types. These are all
 * `object` types, so any contents are skipped in its serialization and only its `type` key is read
 * by the [PolymorphicJsonAdapterFactory] to determine its type.
